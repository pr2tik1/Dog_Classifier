# Dog Image Classification (Transfer Learning)

The image classification is done using pretrained CNNs which is a one of the projects in Udacity's AI with Python Programming Nanodegree. Transfer learning is a popular method in computer vision because it allows us to build accurate models in a timesaving way. 

Transfer learning is usually expressed through the use of pre-trained models. A pre-trained model is a model that was trained on a large benchmark dataset (ImageNet in this case) to solve a problem similar to the one that we solve. 

CNNs used and compared:
  - VGG16
  - AlexNet
  - ResNet
    
Dependencies:
 - Python 3.6+
 - Pytorch (version 0.4+)
 
This repository will be updated with following future Works:
  -[] Adding more images 
  -[] Using more networks
