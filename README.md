# Image Classification

Used pretrained CNNs and custom CNNs to classify dog images in project 1 and dog breeds in project 2. Transfer learning is a popular method in computer vision because it allows us to build accurate models in a timesaving way. These projects were in my Udacity's Nanodegree courses. This can be referred for educational purposes.

## Project 1
Transfer learning is usually expressed through the use of pre-trained models. A pre-trained model is a model that was trained on a large benchmark dataset (ImageNet in this case) to solve a problem similar to the one that we solve. 

CNNs used :
  - VGG16
  - AlexNet
  - ResNet
    
## Project 2 
In this to classify dog breeds pretrained network ResNet and custom net is developed for comparable study. Also a small exploration using HarCascade from OpenCV for face detection is performed. 

## Dependencies:
 - Python 3.6+
 - Pytorch (version 0.4+)
 
## Future Works:
   - Increasing Accuracy
   - Using more networks
